Is Drone down for everyone or just me?
======================================

**Getting telemetry from a drone to a meteor. For lulz. Pushing commands from a meteor to a drone. For kicks. Dangerous spinning robotic kicks.**

**drone-up**: A _"what's the simplest thing that could work"_ app for controlling a Parrot A.R. Drone from Meteor.

Wraps the awesome NodeCopter library [ar-drone](https://github.com/felixge/node-ar-drone)

Thanks to [@teabass](https://twitter.com/teabass)for the leg up. You should all go to a [NodeCopter](http://nodecopter.com/) event.
